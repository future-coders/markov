lived in proportion to their income quietly keeping little company and that little unexpensively but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means the house in town had yielded greater profits and fortune in general had smiled on them with their wealth their views increased their want of a larger house their inclination for more company they added to their house to their number of servants to their expenses of every sort and by this time were in fortune and style of living second only to the family at hartfield their love of society and their new dining room prepared every body for their keeping dinner company and a few parties chiefly among the single men had already taken place the regular and best families emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite neither donwell nor hartfield nor randalls nothing should tempt her to go if they did and she regretted that her father s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish the coles were very respectable in their way but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them this lesson she very much feared they would receive only from herself she had little hope of mr knightley none of mr weston but she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared that when the insult came at last it found her very differently affected donwell and randalls had received their invitation and none had come for her father and herself and mrs weston s accounting for it with i suppose they will not take the liberty with you they know you do not dine out was not quite sufficient she felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal and afterwards as the idea of the party to be assembled there consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her occurred again and again she did not know that she might not have many years of existence before her but he could not be prevailed on by all his father s doubts to say that her complaints were merely imaginary or that she was as strong as ever it soon appeared that london was not the place for her she could not endure its noise her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering and by the ten days end her nephew s letter to randalls communicated a change of plan they were going to remove immediately to richmond mrs churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there and had otherwise a fancy for the place a ready furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged and much benefit expected from the change emma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends for the house was taken for may and june she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them almost as often as he could even wish emma saw how mr weston understood these joyous prospects he was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered she hoped it was not so two months must bring it to the proof mr weston s own happiness was indisputable he was quite delighted it was the very circumstance he could have wished for now it would be really having frank in their neighbourhood what were nine miles to a young man an hour s ride he would be always coming over the difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never sixteen miles nay eighteen it must be full eighteen to manchester street was a serious obstacle were he ever able to get away the day would be spent in coming and returning there was no comfort in having him in london he might as well be at enscombe but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse better than nearer one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal the ball at the crown it had not been forgotten before but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day now however it was absolutely to be every preparation was resumed and very soon after the churchills had removed to richmond a few lines from frank to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty four hours at any given time induced them to name as early a day as possible mr weston s ball was to be a real thing a very few to morrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness mr woodhouse was resigned the time of year lightened the evil to him may was better for every thing than february mrs bates was engaged to spend the evening at hartfield james had due notice and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear little john would have any thing the matter with them while dear emma were gone chapter ii no misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball the day approached the day arrived and after a morning of some anxious watching frank churchill in all the certainty of his own self reached randalls before dinner and every thing was safe no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma the room at the crown can be safer for you than your father s house from the very circumstance of its being larger sir we shall have no occasion to open the windows at all not once the whole evening and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief open the windows but surely mr churchill nobody would think of opening the windows at randalls nobody could be so imprudent i never heard of such a thing dancing with open windows i am sure neither your father nor mrs weston poor miss taylor that was would suffer it ah sir but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window curtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected i have often known it done myself have you indeed sir bless me i never could have supposed it but i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear however this does make a difference and perhaps when we come to talk it over but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry if mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning we may talk it over and see what can be done but unfortunately sir my time is so limited oh interrupted emma there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you yes to be sure i suppose there are but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard she loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid you will think you have overrated hartfield surry is full of beauties oh yes i am quite aware of that it is the garden of england you know surry is the garden of england you know surry is the garden of england you know surry is the garden of england you know surry is the garden of england you know surry is the garden of england yes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction many counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as surry no i fancy not replied mrs elton with a most satisfied smile i never heard any county but surry called so emma was silenced my brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring or summer at farthest continued mrs elton and that will be our time for exploring while they are with us we shall explore a great deal i dare say they will have their barouche landau of course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying any thing of our carriage we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well they would hardly come in their chaise i think at that season of the year indeed when the time draws on i shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche landau it will be so very much preferable when people come into a beautiful country of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible and mr suckling is extremely fond of exploring we explored to king s weston twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouche landau you have many parties of that kind here i suppose miss woodhouse every summer no not immediately here we are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of and we are a very quiet set of people i believe more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure ah there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort nobody can be more devoted to home than i am i was quite a proverb for it at maple grove many a time has selina said when she has been going to bristol i really cannot get this girl to move from the house i absolutely must go in by myself though i hate being stuck up in the barouche landau without a companion but augusta i believe with her own good will would never stir beyond the park paling many a time has she said so and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion i think on the contrary when people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very bad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree without living in it either too much or too little i perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouse looking towards mr woodhouse your father s state of health must be a great drawback why does not he try bath indeed he should let me recommend bath to you i assure you i have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january what a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting he was not exactly what she had expected less of the man of the world in some of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune therefore better than she had expected his ideas seemed more moderate his feelings warmer she was particularly struck by his manner of considering mr elton s house which as well as the church he would go and look at and would not join them in finding much fault with no he could not believe it a bad house not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having that house there must be ample room in it for every real comfort the man must be a blockhead who wanted more mrs weston laughed and said he did not know what manner was they remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must not be kept waiting and harriet then came running to her with a smiling face and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose only think of our happening to meet him how very odd it was indeed so odd harriet s behaviour was so extremely odd that emma did not know how to understand it her character appeared absolutely changed she seemed to propose shewing no agitation or disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery emma looked at her quite unable to speak had you any idea cried harriet of his being in love with her that i should not wonder if it were to end in his being so at last do not beat me chapter xvi every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr elton was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage dinner parties and evening parties were made for him and his lady and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day i see how it is said she i see what a life i am to lead among you upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated we really seem quite the fashion if this is living in the country it is nothing very formidable from monday next to saturday i assure you we have not a disengaged day a woman with fewer resources than i have need not have been at a loss no invitation came amiss to her her bath habits made evening parties perfectly natural to her and maple grove had given her a taste for dinners she was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms at the poor attempt at rout cakes and there being no ice in the highbury card parties mrs bates mrs perry mrs goddard and others were a good deal behind hand in knowledge of the world but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged in the course of the summer but i ought to have gone before not to wait upon a bride is very remiss ah it shews what a sad invalid i am but i do not like the corner into vicarage lane i dare say your apologies were accepted sir mr elton knows you yes but a young lady a bride i ought to have paid my respects to her if possible it was being very deficient but my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride it ought to be no recommendation to you it is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them no my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady and a bride especially is never to be neglected more is avowedly due to her a bride you know my dear is always the first in company let the others be who they may well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know what is and i should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity baits for poor young ladies my dear you do not understand me this is a matter of mere common politeness and good breeding and has nothing to do with any of them good heavens what can be to be broke to me that does not relate to one of that family upon my honour said he very seriously it does not it is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of knightley emma s courage returned and she walked on i was wrong he continued in talking of its being broke to you i should not have used the expression in fact it does not concern you it concerns only myself that is we hope humph in short my dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it i don t say that it is not a disagreeable business but things might be much worse if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls emma found that she must wait and now it required little effort she asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern something just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family something which the late event at richmond had brought forward her fancy was very active half a dozen natural children perhaps and poor frank cut off this though very undesirable would be no matter of agony to her it inspired little more than an animating curiosity who is that gentleman on horseback said she as they proceeded speaking more to assist mr weston in keeping his secret than with any other view i do not know one note from another and our little girls who are but just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it and there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not any thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world to amuse herself with i was saying this to mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought or else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of it we are in great hopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening miss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs cole s turned to frank churchill why do you smile said she nay why do you me i suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbell s being so rich and so liberal it is a handsome present very i rather wonder that it was never made before perhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument which must now be shut up in london untouched by any body that is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large for mrs bates s house you may say what you like quite a humourist well i shall bring jane with me jane and her aunt the rest i leave to you i have no objections at all to meeting the hartfield family don t scruple i know you are attached to them you certainly will meet them if i can prevail and i shall call on miss bates in my way home that s quite unnecessary i see jane every day but as you like it is to be a morning scheme you know knightley quite a simple thing i shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm here probably this basket with pink ribbon nothing can be more simple you see and jane will have such another there is to be no form or parade a sort of gipsy party we are to walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves and sit under trees and whatever else you may like to provide it is to be all out of doors a table spread in the shade you know every thing as natural and simple as possible is not that your idea not quite my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining room the nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture i think is best observed by meals within doors when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house well as you please only don t have a great set out and by the bye can i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion pray be sincere knightley if you wish me to talk to mrs hodges or to inspect anything i have not the least wish for it i thank you well but if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely clever i will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world where is she oh just behind perfectly remember mrs perry s coming extraordinary dream indeed they were entering the hall mr knightley s eyes had preceded miss bates s in a glance at jane from frank churchill s face where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away he had involuntarily turned to hers but she was indeed behind and too busy with her shawl mr weston had walked in the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass mr knightley suspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye he seemed watching her intently in vain however if it were so jane passed between them into the hall and looked at neither there was no time for farther remark or explanation the dream must be borne with and mr knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield and which none but emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use instead of the small sized pembroke on which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded tea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry to move miss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining a table behind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken away their alphabets their box of letters it used to stand here where is it this is a sort of dull looking evening that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer we had great amusement with those letters one morning i want to puzzle you again emma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves they were rapidly forming words for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled the quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for mr woodhouse who had often been distressed by the more animated sort which mr weston had occasionally introduced and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over the departure of the poor little boys or in fondly pointing out as he took up any stray letter near him how beautifully emma had written it frank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax she gave a slight glance round the table and applied herself to it frank was next to emma jane opposite to them and mr knightley so placed as to see them all and it was his object to blind all about him and no one i am sure could be more effectually blinded than myself except that i was not blinded that it was my good fortune that in short i was somehow or other safe from him she had hoped for an answer here for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible but he was silent and as far as she could she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised on one side of the fire frank churchill at a table near her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and jane fairfax standing with her back to them intent on her pianoforte busy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing emma again this is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at least ten minutes earlier than i had calculated you find me trying to be useful tell me if you think i shall succeed what said mrs weston have not you finished it yet you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate i have not been working uninterruptedly he replied i have been assisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily it was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe you see we have been wedging one leg with paper this was very kind of you to be persuaded to come i was almost afraid you would be hurrying home he contrived that she should be seated by him and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying to make her help or advise him in his work till jane fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again that she was not immediately ready emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion she must reason herself into the power of performance and emma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again at last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to mrs weston had been delighted before and was delighted again emma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every proper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise whoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill with a smile at emma the person has not chosen ill i heard a good deal of colonel campbell s taste at weymouth and the softness of the upper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would particularly prize i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave his friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself do not you think so jane did not look round she was not obliged to hear mrs weston had been speaking to her at the same moment it is not fair said emma in a whisper not at all you are ungrateful ungrateful what do you mean then changing from a frown to a smile no do not tell me i do not want to think ill of him i should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are merely personal that he is well grown and good looking with smooth plausible manners well if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a treasure at highbury we do not often look upon fine young men well bred and agreeable we must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain cannot you imagine mr knightley what a sensation his coming will produce there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest one object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else you will excuse my being so much over powered if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts my idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body though single and though poor poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm dear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself when you grow old if i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great many independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be more in want of a friend or an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present trouble aye i know your scruples you are afraid of giving me trouble but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can hardly be more interested about you than i am i shall write to mrs partridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look out for any thing eligible thank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject to her till the time draws nearer i do not wish to make any yet oh my dear we cannot begin too early you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing i not aware said jane shaking her head dear mrs elton who can have thought of it as i have done but you have not seen so much of the world as i have you do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations i saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove a cousin of mr suckling mrs bragge had such an infinity of applications every body was anxious to be in her family for she moves in the first circle wax candles in the schoolroom you may imagine how desirable of all houses in the kingdom mrs bragge s is the one i would most wish to see you in colonel and mrs campbell are to be in town again by midsummer said jane i must spend some time with them i am sure they will want it afterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself but i would not wish you to take the trouble of conquering any body s reserve to procure one intimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question he replied but you must often wish it i am sure and he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another step this present from the campbells said she this pianoforte is very kindly given yes he replied and without the smallest apparent embarrassment but they would have done better had they given her notice of it surprizes are foolish things the pleasure is not enhanced and the inconvenience is often considerable i should have expected better judgment in colonel campbell from that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument but whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment whether there were no actual preference remained a little longer doubtful towards the end of jane s second song her voice grew thick that will do said he when it was finished thinking aloud you have sung quite enough for one evening now be quiet another song however was soon begged for one more they would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for one more and frank churchill was heard to say i think you could manage this without effort the first part is so very trifling the strength of the song falls on the second mr knightley grew angry that fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice this must not be and touching miss bates who at that moment passed near miss bates are you mad to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner go and interfere they have no mercy on her miss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even to be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing here ceased the concert part of the evening for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers but soon within five minutes the proposal of dancing originating nobody exactly knew where was so effectually promoted by mr and mrs cole that every thing was rapidly clearing away to give proper space mrs weston capital in her country dances was seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and frank churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to emma had secured her hand and led her up to the top while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off emma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste to look about and see what became of mr knightley this would be a trial he was no dancer in general if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur something there was no immediate appearance no he was talking to mrs cole he was looking on unconcerned jane was asked by somebody else and he was still talking to mrs cole emma had no longer an alarm for henry his interest was yet safe and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment not more than five couple could be mustered but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful and she found herself well matched in a partner they were a couple worth looking at two dances unfortunately were all that could be safely judged of under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of mr churchill she believed every body found his manners pleasing emma could not forgive her chapter iii emma could not forgive her but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr knightley who had been of the party and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side he was expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on business with mr woodhouse his approbation of the whole not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma he had been used to think her unjust to jane and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement a very pleasant evening he began as soon as mr woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary told that he understood and the papers swept away particularly pleasant you and miss fairfax gave us some very good music i do not know a more luxurious state sir than sitting at one s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma true sir and emma because she had miss fairfax emma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for the present said and with a sincerity which no one could question she is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one s eyes from i am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart mr knightley looked as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account than on harriet s more anxious that she should escape the infection than that there should be no infection in the complaint he began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick chamber again for the present to entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr perry and learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off nay how could i help saying what i did nobody could have helped it it was not so very bad i dare say she did not understand me i assure you she did she felt your full meaning she has talked of it since i wish you could have heard how she talked of it with what candour and generosity i wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome oh cried emma i know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her they are blended said he i acknowledge and were she prosperous i could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner were she your equal in situation but emma consider how far this is from being the case she is poor she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live to old age must probably sink more her situation should secure your compassion it was badly done indeed you whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her and before her niece too and before others many of whom certainly some would be entirely guided by your treatment of her this is not pleasant to you emma and it is very far from pleasant to me but i must i will i will tell you truths while i can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now while they talked they were advancing towards the carriage it was ready and before she could speak again he had handed her in he had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted and her tongue motionless they were combined only of anger against herself mortification and deep concern she had not been able to speak and on entering the carriage sunk back for a moment overcome then reproaching herself for having taken no leave making no acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference but it was just too late he had turned away and the horses were in motion she continued to look back but in vain and soon with what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill and every thing left far behind she was vexed beyond what could have been expressed almost beyond what she could conceal never had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance in her life she was most forcibly struck the truth of this representation there was no denying she felt it at her heart how could she have been so brutal so cruel to miss bates how could you be so unfeeling to your father i must i will tell you truths while i can miss bates should never again no never if attention in future could do away the past she might hope to be forgiven she had been often remiss her conscience told her so remiss perhaps more in thought than fact scornful ungracious but it should be so no more in the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her the very next morning and it should be the beginning on her side of a regular equal kindly intercourse she was just as determined when the morrow came and went early that nothing might prevent her it was not unlikely she thought that she might see mr knightley in her way or perhaps he might come in while she were paying her visit she had no objection she would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly and truly hers her eyes were towards donwell as she walked but she saw him not the ladies were all at home she had never rejoiced at the sound before nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs with any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation or of deriving it except in subsequent ridicule there was a bustle on her approach a good deal of moving and talking she heard miss bates s voice something was to be done in a hurry the maid looked frightened and awkward hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment and then ushered her in too soon the aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room jane she had a distinct glimpse of looking extremely ill and before the door had shut them out she heard miss bates saying well my dear i shall say you are laid down upon the bed and i am sure you are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared to abbey mill and i am sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife i shall always have a great regard for but that is quite a different thing no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has told me himself i met him just now he told me it was to be a whole length in water colours like mr john knightley s and was destined if she could please herself to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece the sitting began and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist but there was no doing any thing but lament and exclaim the loss of the ball the loss of the young man and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the sanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly emma remained in a state of vexation too but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her s than in his she did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary s wrong as mr knightley he walked off in more complete self approbation than he left for her she was not so materially cast down however but that a little time and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives harriet s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy the possibility of the young man s coming to mrs goddard s that mr martin had been there an hour before and finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away and on opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two songs which she had lent elizabeth to copy a letter to herself and this letter was from him from mr martin and contained a direct proposal of marriage who could have thought it she was so surprized she did not know what to do i was sitting near the door elizabeth saw me directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella i am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took no notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop and i kept sitting near the door oh dear i was so miserable i am sure i must have been as white as my gown i could not go away you know because of the rain but i did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there oh dear miss woodhouse well at last i fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going on with her buyings they began whispering to one another i am sure they were talking of me and i could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me do you think he was miss woodhouse for presently she came forward came quite up to me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands if i would she did not do any of it in the same way that she used i could see she was altered but however she seemed to try to be very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time but i know no more what i said i was in such a tremble i remember she said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost too kind dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable by that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away and then only think i found he was coming up towards me too slowly you know and as if he did not very well know what answer to make which was exactly the case for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of her s he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit but emma too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially or see him with clear vision was very well satisfied with what she did say and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already it was well that he took every body s joy for granted or he might not have thought either mr woodhouse or mr knightley particularly delighted they were the first entitled after mrs weston and emma to be made happy from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley that it would have been too positive an interruption and finding himself close to mrs elton and her attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject with her chapter xviii i hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you said mr weston mrs elton very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope smiled most graciously you have heard of a certain frank churchill i presume he continued and know him to be my son though he does not bear my name oh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance i am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage you are very obliging frank will be extremely happy i am sure he is to be in town next week if not sooner we have notice of it in a letter to day i met the letters in my way this morning and seeing my son s hand presumed to open it though it was not directed to me it was to mrs weston she is his principal correspondent i assure you i hardly ever get a letter and so you absolutely opened what was directed to her oh mr weston laughing affectedly i must protest against that a most dangerous precedent indeed i beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example upon my word if this is what i am to expect we married women must begin to exert ourselves oh mr weston i could not have believed it even of him mr weston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all the right of being principal talker which a day spent anywhere from home confers was making himself agreeable among the rest and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten and spread abroad what public news he had heard was proceeding to a family communication which though principally addressed to mrs weston he had not the smallest doubt nor have i now that there would be a general cry out upon her extreme good luck even your satisfaction i made sure of it crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend s leaving highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings i assure you mine are very different i must think your statement by no means fair you are not just to harriet s claims they would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself mr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society the sphere in which she moves is much above his it would be a degradation a degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married to a miss hawkins by his style i should imagine it just settled mr elton going to be married said emma as soon as i am cooler i shall go back again i could very ill be spared but such a point had been made of my coming you will all be going soon i suppose the whole party breaking up i met one as i came madness in such weather absolute madness emma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchill s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour some people were always cross when they were hot such might be his constitution and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints she recommended his taking some refreshment he would find abundance of every thing in the dining room and she humanely pointed out the door no he should not eat he was not hungry it would only make him hotter in two minutes however he relented in his own favour and muttering something about spruce beer walked off emma returned all her attention to her father saying in secret i am glad i have done being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit she had not the best she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all she could not be complying she dreaded being quarrelsome her heroism reached only to silence she allowed him to talk and arranged the glasses and wrapped herself up without opening her lips they arrived the carriage turned the step was let down and mr elton spruce black and smiling was with them instantly emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject mr elton was all obligation and cheerfulness he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed that she began to think he must have received a different account of harriet from what had reached her she had sent while dressing and the answer had been much the same not better my report from mrs goddard s said she presently was not so pleasant as i had hoped not better was my answer his face lengthened immediately and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered oh no i am grieved to find i was on the point of telling you that when i called at mrs goddard s door which i did the very last thing before i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better by no means better rather worse very much grieved and concerned i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning emma smiled and answered my visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint i hope but not even i can charm away a sore throat it is a most severe cold indeed mr perry has been with her as you probably heard yes i imagined that is i did not he has been used to her in these complaints and i hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness such a sad loss to our party to day dreadful exactly so indeed she will be missed every moment this was very proper the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable but it should have lasted longer emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment what an excellent device said he the use of a sheepskin for carriages how very comfortable they make it impossible to feel cold with such precautions the contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman s carriage perfectly complete one is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted weather becomes absolutely of no consequence it is a very cold afternoon but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter let no name ever pass our lips we were very wrong before we will be cautious now he is your superior no doubt and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature but yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have been matches of greater disparity but take care of yourself i would not have you too sanguine though however it may end be assured your raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste which i shall always know how to value harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation chapter v in this state of schemes and hopes and connivance june opened upon hartfield to highbury in general it brought no material change the eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings and of the use to be made of their barouche landau and jane fairfax was still at her grandmother s and as the return of the campbells from ireland was again delayed and august instead of midsummer fixed for it she was likely to remain there full two months longer provided at least she were able to defeat mrs elton s activity in her service and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will mr knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly taken an early dislike to frank churchill was only growing to dislike him more he began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with jane fairfax he could not understand it but there were symptoms of intelligence between them he thought so at least symptoms of admiration on his side which having once observed he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning however he might wish to escape any of emma s errors of imagination she was not present when the suspicion first arose he was dining with the randalls family and jane at the eltons and he had seen a look more than a single look at miss fairfax which from the admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place when he was again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight myself creating what i saw brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking of private understanding even between frank churchill and jane he had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did to spend his evening at hartfield emma and harriet were going to walk he joined them and on returning they fell in with a larger party who like themselves judged it wisest to take their exercise early as the weather threatened rain mr and mrs weston and mr elton sat down with mr woodhouse to cards the remaining five were left to their own powers and emma doubted their getting on very well for mr knightley seemed little disposed for conversation mrs elton was wanting notice which nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent mr john knightley proved more talkative than his brother he was to leave them early the next day and he soon began with well emma i do not believe i did you any good the good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me i could not excuse a man s having more music than love more ear than eye a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings how did miss campbell appear to like it it was her very particular friend you know poor comfort said emma laughing one would rather have a stranger preferred than one s very particular friend with a stranger it might not recur again but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself poor mrs dixon well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland you are right it was not very flattering to miss campbell but she really did not seem to feel it so much the better or so much the worse i do not know which it ought to be called oh good i am sure i see it in your countenance you are trying not to smile i am afraid said he composing his features i am very much afraid my dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it indeed but why so i can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too there is one subject he replied i hope but one on which we do not think alike he paused a moment again smiling with his eyes fixed on her face does nothing occur to you do not you recollect harriet smith her cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something though she knew not what have you heard from her yourself this morning cried he you have i believe and know the whole no i have not i know nothing pray tell me you are prepared for the worst i see and very bad it is harriet smith marries robert martin emma gave a start which did not seem like being prepared and her eyes in eager gaze said no this is impossible but her lips were closed it is so indeed continued mr knightley i have it from robert martin himself he left me not half an hour ago she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement you like it my emma as little as i feared i wish our opinions were the same but in time they will time you may be sure will make one or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile we need not talk much on the subject you mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy but i cannot believe it i must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet to be tempted mr elton you know recollecting herself is out of the question and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father and
