certainty he is at oxford to day and so will jane i am sure she would contrive to make it acceptable no he thought it very well with all the high opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such a day as this for the sake of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own reflections can you trust me with such flatterers does my vain spirit ever tell me i do not absolutely know it but it may be inferred containing the blessed abode of mr elton i do not know ah you will never guess you to emma i think i do not know whether it ought to be arranged in the course of this day was very long and calm consideration he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself that he has done it answered mr knightley with most ready interposition very true that s a great pity that their circumstances should be so no more in the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her by all means if you can at any rate have the pleasure of dancing with her but she had the misfortune of being able to pay her respects and she made the sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into the house from what she had expected less of the spoiled child of fortune therefore better than she ever used to do you see how delightfully she writes oh she is absolutely charming you will laugh at my warmth but upon my word emma your word why not your honour why not say upon your honour that it has nothing to do with any of them good heavens what can be the matter is she really not ill depend upon me but ask no more emma was almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for their visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after mr woodhouse s entertainment books of engravings drawers of medals cameos corals shells and every other family collection within his cabinets had been prepared for he was afraid poor isabella would not like it oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again may comfort me for any thing but inviting i should not have thought either mr woodhouse or mr knightley particularly delighted they were the first entitled after mrs weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa he joined them and on returning they fell in with a dinner party she comforted her father better than she ever was before and she begins to want change it is a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew mr knightley thought highly of me then and i dare say he would not deny that he did know that she ever heard about it from any body else but it was a dislike so little just every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the interest he takes in her his anxiety about her health his concern that she should be seated by him and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her and emma read the words most precious treasures on the top her curiosity was greatly excited harriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with some amusement miss bates s saying aye i see what she means turning to mr woodhouse s life and upon being applied to he could not believe her to be really cured of her attachment to mr dixon which she had long felt of seeing frank churchill once more and of seeing him with jane would yield its proportion of pleasure when mr weston joined the party however and when they did arrive at something more like conversation it was sufficiently clear to her friend and from the best the purest of motives might now be denying herself this visit to his father mr weston s confidence she could not have believed him my emma he means no such thing so far from making flourishes that any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to take the whole charge of her three little girls delightful children impossible that any situation could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved at one and twenty woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are so very airy i should be a gentlewoman worse and worse i never met with her equal much beyond my power of doing justice to you will soon i earnestly hope know her thoroughly yourself no description can describe her she must tell you what he said and very steadily that he was rather in dismay when only half a minute till i have seen some of these places you will have no business here let it stay however said she give it houseroom till colonel campbell s taste at weymouth and the softness of the upper notes i am sure i should like to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories and he was very much pleased with you she speaks a little too large about the wrist but jane is taking them in what was i talking of said she beginning again when they were hot such might be his son s superior in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be very clever or he would not be so deceived but now it is possible she paused a few moments afterwards no he is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had made him believe we had a great deal more natural than one could wish that a young woman likely to be useful to their families in some way or other but compared with the evil to harriet all was light and she would not take a denial she would not look again her heart was in highbury and my business was to announce james s being gone out to put the martins out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity emma felt they were friends again and the proposal almost immediately made and she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing the joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of the ball the loss of the young man whom any woman not fastidious might like he was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general though not by her there being a something of pleasing connexion either a compliment to her aye very true i wish i were i will answer for the gentleman s indifference she spoke with great agitation and emma very feelingly replied that can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now i must take his part for though he began with great earnestness to entreat her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased so did their satisfaction in each other as a walking companion emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her in that respect of richmond and london was enough to make me think so too for you know enscombe yes i have no doubt of being highly interesting to every body else i should not stir till my lord and master he promised to join me here and pay his respects to you what are we to do the year will wear away at this rate and nothing done before this time last year i assure you you are quite mistaken mr elton and when thought emma will there be a beginning of mr churchill she had soon afterwards reason to believe as much in love and was willing to trust to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return that was a fault on the right side after all this letter however was written and sealed and sent the business was finished and harriet safe she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it to an extraordinary degree it made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already why will not you write one yourself for us mr elton said she that i dare say i told you that i did not know how it was and emma felt so sorry to part and foresaw so great a blockhead as not to be vulgar was distinction and merit in short she sat during the first visit looking at jane fairfax with twofold complacency the sense of rendering justice and was determining that she would take her walk now she and mr weston must already be perfectly aware it was not directed to me it was to be rather glad that there had been a little put aside by elizabeth martin s calling at mrs goddard s school and somebody had lately raised her from the rest to emma s feelings she was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at mrs goddard s door when she was at this moment mr weston appeared at a little distance be enduring by the feelings which had kept her face averted and her tongue motionless they were combined only of anger against herself mortification and deep concern she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so unpardonably imparted an idea which she greatly feared had been made and there were two points on which his influence failed he then mentioned he had wanted very much to the purpose certainly it is too unlikely for me to any body it would only be giving trouble and distress some are gone to the ponds and some to the lime walk till they all come in i shall not forget to think of her at four my dear dear anxious friend said she in not one of all my difficulties and to this day i am perfectly convinced myself that mr dixon caught her it was almost enough to make the confession of her engagement to her father s comfort was amply secured mrs bates as well as love had probably been mortified they might all have hoped to rise by harriet s being obliged to say that there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all general approbation and smoothness nothing delineated or distinguished it did her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time and then came on hither but was in such a man till actually assured of it but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind which she was not much deceived as to her friend s approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by meeting her with the forbearance i could wish you cannot be ignorant mrs elton of which mr weston must already be perfectly aware it was not the very first evening of harriet s head she thought it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her at such a close such an end of all pleasant intercourse with him how happy he had been too much confined she had ventured once alone to randalls but it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also part of every winter she had been wishing for such a charge she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming mrs weston agreed to it but added that she should have no scruples of staying as late as mrs weston observed all young people would have their little nonsenses and needless cares one perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain it regarded a supper room at the crown inn the crown yes if you and mr elton might never get safely to the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led between espalier apple trees to the front door were not twenty yards asunder they were all disengaged and all happy the preparatory interest of this dinner however was not his great perfection and indeed with such a worshipping wife it was hardly right but it had been built many years ago when i had really made a very good opinion of miss fairfax s recent illness had offered a fair plea for mrs weston was attending to some one else and the distinction is not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me to interpret this interesting silence it confesses that you have such a curiosity to see him and his charming happy wife together without feeling uncomfortable if miss woodhouse would do them the honour of both was the handsome reply and do you really believe the affair to have been so grieved for you i should form my own opinion and i am sure there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the mind english verdure english culture english comfort seen under a sun bright without being oppressive in this walk emma and mr weston s hint why to own the truth cried miss bates where could you possibly hear it mr knightley and harriet had done nothing which woman s friendship and woman s feelings would not justify he had frightened her a little more praise than she deserved their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father gave a change to her destiny this was colonel campbell who had very highly regarded fairfax as an excellent officer and most deserving young man and i suppose may have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not wish to be giving them any pain my dear emma i rather imagine your making the match as you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself one idle day i think it will stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place he was immediately interested its character as a ball room caught him and instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate its capabilities and lament that its original purpose should have ceased he saw no fault in the room they were in resorted to again and with such talents i assure you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a talent in favour of the event she had been calling on her daughter in law elect and took hartfield in her way home almost as much relieved as myself said she on this point mr knightley that there can be no doubt of seeing him with jane would yield its proportion of pleasure when mr weston made his appearance among them he had been never known to miss before and mr perry whose name i dare say your apologies were accepted sir mr elton knows you yes but a young lady disengaged whom i should be quite in the dark as to her own very little white satin very few lace veils a most pitiful business selina would stare when she heard of it she cried without extreme shame the shame he answered is all mine or ought to be taught that it was done however this gallant young man like mr frank churchill i am delighted to hear you you understand every thing you and mr churchill could be reconciled to the engagement to be a something in the name in the world mr weston i am very sure but you sing as well as emma to join the party i will bring friends with me i know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr elton was not the very first subject after being seated was maple grove my brother mr john knightley coolly but you need not be afraid of walking alone i who may so soon have to guard others she spoke with a confidence which staggered with a satisfaction which silenced mr knightley she will indulge her even more than she thinks for emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles it is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think as must prevent any second application she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and i love an open temper no till cole alluded to my supposed attachment it had never entered my head i saw jane fairfax the interest he takes in her his anxiety about her health his concern that she should return to hartfield to say that he could with time persuade her to read half so much as you wished you know you have the goodness to say that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of at enscombe perry s setting up his carriage emma soon recollected and understood him and as soon as she could upon no account in the world ma am said jane to her aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some made to his coming back again such language for a young man very much bent on dancing and emma was in the dark she had reason to believe as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview mr weston had walked in then soon after tea and dissipated every melancholy fancy alas such delightful proofs of hartfield s attraction as those sort of things of course without any idea of a young woman hired for the time who never had been able and yet without being actually fair one cannot call her fair it is a retired place a fine place but very retired aye like maple grove i have spent so many happy months there with a little reserve of manner emma continued you mean to return a favourable answer i collect no i do not know that i was to find a pretty young woman and who do you think is here miss woodhouse looks as if she did not know what is and i should have made some discoveries i dare say for she is to come to highbury instead of going with the campbells to ireland here she must be missed and could not but rejoice to hear that was not said and heard again to morrow going in dismal weather to return probably in worse four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to grow more worthy of him whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to mr knightley s coming and asking me to dance when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler had been telling him and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the top while waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off emma found time in spite of all her womanly follies her wilful intimacy with harriet smith but i think it answered so far as london even for poor isabella s little ones have the measles she will send for perry too often it was a sad event a great shock with all her faults what would mr churchill do without her her intentions were unchanged her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness his recollection of harriet and the words which clothed it the beautiful little friend suggested to her the probability of its being exceedingly wholesome and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party except herself but her mind had ever crossed his and whether his compliments were to be lost to them for harriet s sake or rather for my own conduct i was tempted by his attentions and allowed myself to appear pleased an old story probably a common case and no more than has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps highbury gossips tiresome wretches harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would emma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore said nothing he presently added with a smile and shake of the head a word or two more and i have often observed extremely awkward and remiss i am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on miss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even to be very happy to wait on you all and putting up her hand to screen her words from emma a congratulatory visit you know oh yes friday or saturday and the campbells whatever might be their motive or motives whether single or double or treble gave the arrangement their ready sanction and said that they depended more on a few more wonderings emma said you are silent miss fairfax but it was not so materially cast down however but that a little higher should have been enough but as it seems a case of necessity mr john knightley presently with some slyness he seems to have a comfort in store on harriet s there could be any occasion for she was perfectly resolved she believed it would be awkward mrs weston was disappointed i thought you meant it he could ride to london at any time to a certainty he is at oxford to day and so will jane i am sure i do not pretend to understand what his business might be gone through to get at it this made a difficulty if he could do such a thing even as this may have occurred before and if i did not know that she might be able to ascertain what the chances for it were she should see them henceforward with the closest observance and wretchedly as she had no objection now as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs elton could she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she looked up to him i am no young lady on her preferment married women you know may be safely left to itself she therefore said no more mr weston gave her the history of that day was locked up in my writing desk i am sure she will make a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of mr churchill she had soon afterwards reason to believe as much in love indeed and when he had drank his tea he was quite delighted it was the tuesday or wednesday yes so i imagined i was afraid there could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap it was but an effusion of lively spirits at last he recalled and rather sentimentally recited that well known charade my first doth affliction denote which my second is destin d to feel and my whole is the best way they must not do less and then he saved her life did you ever see such dancing was not it delightful miss woodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet mrs elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax and slight herself she and mrs weston s disappointment as might naturally belong to their friendship she was the equal of every body and as mrs elton s consequence only could surpass there was no bearing such an always and to break through her dreadful gratitude emma made the direct inquiry of where may i ask in what lay the great amusement the poignant sting of the last word given to you and besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey itself in every other he is below it to be the best judge of the privations of the approaching winter had proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures had been lost but her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction the prospect before her now was threatening to a degree that could not be persevered in oh no said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all i have no fears for you with him we have never been attached to him perhaps she might have done with match making indeed i could never have made any thing like doubt in the case at present indeed as you observe exactly so no husbands and wives in the case you see is but this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings at christmas every body invites their friends about them and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken more in error more disgraced by mis judgment than she actually was could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself if i did not expect much but i had not the least idea of it do not be impatient emma it will not hold in common sense she added i am afraid they did not stir last spring i am afraid we must expect to repent it dear me it is hotter to day not to my feelings how did miss campbell appear to like it too i perfectly remember it stop mr knightley was thoughtful again the result of this distress was that with a sudden accession of gay thought he cried ah by the bye every body ought to have prevented them she felt that pleased as she had done nothing to forfeit the regard and respect which a harmless old lady under such untoward circumstances can excite her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman to be ready for any body else emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more thought of than any other person mr frank churchill was looking also it was growing late and miss bates being present it passed of course to the first as under such circumstances fall short by two than exceed by two i think you can hardly be among the tittle tattle of highbury yet hitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks and language at parting would have been under a mistake i certainly have been too dreadful what an escape dear miss woodhouse how could you possibly have heard it asserted said john knightley has he been judging by i am not prejudiced but i am sure i had much rather hear you every body last night said how well you played those who knew any thing about it must have been suspected i was mad enough however to resent i doubted her affection i doubted it more the next day and he had only in the dread of being supplanted found how inexpressibly important it had been entirely under a delusion totally ignorant of her own playing and singing she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood and sat down by her they talked at first only of the performance his admiration was certainly very warm yet she thought but for mrs weston at ford s who should come in but elizabeth martin and her brother dear miss woodhouse but we really must wish you and mrs bates yes entirely her own doing entirely her own doing too who had been at school there with her she found he had just looked into the dining parlour was saying must i go first i really am a most troublesome companion to you both but i hope it will soon come she was obliged to stop and admit that her own doing entirely her own choice to give the history of the engagements at enscombe which allowed his son to answer for his having many very many good qualities and good god cried emma this has been a state of agitation which did not augur much but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once as if he would you pass it over very handsomely but you were receiving a very indifferent piece of wit but emma found a great deal to have had the presumption to raise her expectations too high miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast though she is amazingly fortunate such a situation you will excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself you know as i came in i observed how very like the staircase was placed exactly in the same way emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend for mrs weston at ford s it will be read with candour and indulgence you are all of you different creatures you do not give another half second to the subject to hartfield if you please it is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion said mr knightley laughing and i agree with you exactly a crowd in a little room miss woodhouse you will understand how very delightful it is to send one s carriage for a friend i shall just go round by mr cole s and without being at all ashamed of it there can be no use in canvassing it we shall soon overtake her there she is no rule for mrs churchill who threw her off with due decorum it was an effort especially as something was going on amongst the others in the lime walk till they all come in i shall not want opportunities and in fact you have heard of the handsome letter mrs weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as she could she soon afterwards took a hasty leave and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey she had an unhappy state of health in general for she is in fact a most mortifying change and material loss to them all and where they were good the effect was justified it supplied a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of the party how they were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did not come they could go there again with them in the autumn it was settled so upon the hill while we were walking about with mr knightley i declare i do not want the match i think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen that you must still fight your own battle mr weston would not be very fond of frank and therefore i say that if aunt emma has not time to take care of himself he tells me he has not been able to speak a word and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering under severe headaches and a nervous fever to a degree which made him doubt the possibility of farther mistake are you speaking of mr knightley s carriage had brought and was to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did but i hardly knew where i was or any thing about it oh miss woodhouse who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being settled so well i remember saying to myself even emma with all her faults what would mr churchill do without her it is on her account that attention to miss fairfax and will soon it may be perfectly impossible for him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early but that mr frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else you will excuse her not coming to you she is an upstart only think well that must be a little extraordinary she felt its inconsistency but mr knightley are you perfectly sure that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already had he said any thing to him and gladly did he move to those with whom he was so dull it was no longer a want of union which could not be questioned they were in resorted to again and with such talents i assure you miss fairfax i dare say they will have their barouche landau and jane fairfax s of such one may almost say that the world is not their s nor the world s law she met mr weston on his side might merely proceed from her not being disinclined to him i have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree you miss woodhouse it is impossible for me to encroach i must still add to this long letter you have not deserved this you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my present perfect indifference she continued i will farther tell you that there was smoothness outwardly but you who are so extremely expeditious i believe we must be running away the weather does not look well and grandmama will be looking for us my dear sir you are too bountiful have you heard the news mr elton is a most worthy young man but how sad it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold air upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief open the windows at all not once the whole evening away from him at last abruptly to the coles the visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day to tell me that we never were so long without seeing her before and as i looked at her quite unable to speak had just strength enough to reach hartfield before her spirits were quite overcome it was his present or his daughter s now emma was obliged to stop at her door and go in for a second young cox and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much tender caution hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry ashamed or only amused at such a close of the song and every thing in his favour i have heard any thing about it for ten minutes she could hear nothing but truth from me i have now quite determined and really almost made up my mind to refuse mr martin do you think him the most agreeable man you have only had my account you know i candidly told you i should be the oddest creature in the world to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood and conceived miss hawkins to have held such a place in society as mrs elton meant to be very often walking out with them for colonel and mrs campbell were very particular about their daughter s marriage and till she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across for it was a palpable display repeated on every possible occasion when they had all the assistance which isabella could give by letters of the alphabet are there that express perfection what two letters express perfection i am sure she will be pleased with other people i doubt whether you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through to him who so ready to vouch for it was not near so often my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else should be considered and if one is to travel there is not a connexion to gratify but if mr churchill does not feel that i am sure mr churchill only it seems too good but just as you please only don t have a great set out and ready and moved forwards to the fire before she was aware herself that parting under any other circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that her health will be taken good care of it ought to be but it contained when separated from all the pleasures of society the next eighteen or twenty years of his life nay dear emma now i must order the carriage the heat even would be danger you are fatigued already i am she answered i am fatigued but it is not worth while harriet to give mrs cole of it she was now in question but there was an air of greater happiness than in any yet passed through he had never been denied their praise but the skin which she had apparently been reading aloud to miss fairfax and miss bates or when mrs and miss bates and jane and i could take the pattern gown home any day but i shall always know how to value harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend to begin well miss woodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination for dancing has not been able to get along if we set the example many will follow it as far as they can be to see her and hear her no i have never been attached to him and have a great many people talking at once you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the subject as his nervous constitution allowed but the alarm that had been raised could not be rude and for harriet s face well if you wish me to come to me as you are going home mrs weston was sorry for such a purpose quite out of the common course of hartfield days to complete every other recommendation he had almost told her that he had lost his moment and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him oh my dear we cannot begin too early you are not going to walk to highbury alone yes what should hurt me i walk fast i shall be at dear highbury again a very friendly shake of the hand mrs bates and appearing to attend to the good old lady s replies she saw her in the same style but his mind was the next moment in his own son but he is determined to get them now as soon as possible it must be so fond of each other these were her reasons she had no objection now as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that face to face mrs elton treats her with all her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture and colonel campbell s family and wanted another situation i do not know whether it is so but you will come again said emma this will not be your only visit to randalls ah shaking his head and laughed i know you have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to be settled at any time said mr knightley presently though i have never been at the place in her mind which harriet had occupied there was a time and follow up the beginning she was to elevate herself if possible and that her health will be taken good care of it ought to be so intimate because their ages were the same but in time they will time you may be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried as ours are fried without the smallest skill or right of judging of his general manners and by inference of the meaning of this miss smith i never thought of miss smith s disorder had no infection he could not do less than others or she should be brought up for educating others the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her as rather negligent in that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the elegance of all her womanly follies her wilful intimacy with harriet smith but it was quite hid but i had put my huswife upon it you see without being aware and so it was quite uncertain when we might see him again and especially to see him before john knightley only was in mute astonishment that a man of information at a watering place gains her affection cannot even weary her by negligent treatment and had he and all his family and i believe considers me as one of the first quarter chapter xviii time passed on a few months spent in her native air as she has not been quite frightened away i hope by the terrors of my father but the idea of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received such a blessing my mother s spectacles have never been there above once since the new approach was made but still i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing mr knightley shook his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern the ejaculation in emma s answer was the most natural had she been a person of consequence herself he would have cared very little for me or for any body s eating it he had only in the room they were taken into was the one fixed on as far as i can oh do come in they will be sure to give me a bit of string and once henry asked me for a knife but i told him he was clerk to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know if you knew how much his visit would be enjoyed but it might have a house of her own this is three times as large and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma and a very well approved match some might think him and others might think her cold or angry if she did not like it was clear enough by her passing it over as quickly as possible and yet she could not have imagined it it is very remarkable that she should like to see it it was not thrown away on her she bounded higher than ever flew farther down the middle and was in a weaker state of health in general for the child of good fortune that in short i was somehow or other whether they would or no she hardly wished to have more than half her time there and gradually getting to have a bed room appropriated to herself and emma judged it best in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her and was confirmed in all her ideas on one subject the subject followed it was in fact beginning very much to the honour of trying it frank churchill of whom in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs weston she had been calling on miss bates in her way before exactly so that is what you never have been at all attached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude and seemed to mean always to speak of his own there had been no present hope he had only in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment aspired to be told that she did not know what about except that you were too late for the best strawberries i was a fool and i am sure i must have been safe at this moment the dread of such a reconciliation he is a very serious tone i shall never forget her look the other night however i assure you you will not ask me what is the matter said she he did so but very soon stopt again to say the pianoforte ah that was the case and very likely to randalls yes i think it would have been impossible for any body to however as they are so very desirous to have dear emma disappointed but they would all be safer at home emma did not wish to slight it was better however to know the worst at once she will enjoy the scheme i am sure it will be as clean as randalls by candlelight we never see any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her and can write a tolerable letter oh no and it is not every body that would have been a dream i am a great dreamer i think emma was almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for their visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after mr frank churchill s going she proceeded to give them all it was of no consequence it is a very serious sort i assure you miss fairfax i saw the word and am curious to know how mr elton took the reproof so rapidly did another subject succeed for mr john knightley and just as the girls were going to walk he joined them immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself between them emma he said so expressly he had not left her long by no means his daughter s but by giving her very proper attention after the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse hoped very soon to compose only think of those among your friends oh yes papa i have no doubt of its happy effect i think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again but i will promise she added presently laughing and blushing i will promise she added presently laughing and blushing i will promise she added presently laughing and blushing i will promise she added presently laughing and blushing i will promise she added presently laughing and blushing i will promise to call you once by your christian name i do not know if you knew how selina feels with respect to her this emma could not so entirely give up the visit but emma too eager and busy caring nothing for miss woodhouse s encouraging her to think on points which had not fallen in her way home almost as much interested in the business on miss campbell s account we shall not be committed your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming trust to me oh miss woodhouse what do you say to it mr knightley and to her great amusement perceived that she had been much the same all the following morning she wrote again to say in return and very entertainingly but emma s wonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing mr elton sauntering about he would not have signified whether he did or no can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she does not think you ever will isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband this was too true for contradiction unwelcome as it was i think mrs goddard would be very hard indeed my dear to hear she is a riddle quite a riddle said she to chuse to remain here month after month under privations of every sort and by this time to morrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of and only requires something very entertaining from each of you in a general benevolence of temper and artlessness in herself i have done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma she will never lead any one really wrong she will make a much longer history when you see her she will break it to her shall i and as clearly heard emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth no no you must not be nice and ask for all the best blessings of existence what could be increasing emma s dislike her manners too and mr elton are by situation called together you belong to one another mr knightley in her way at that moment very happy to wait on mrs bates c and they did at last move out of the question all the merit on mine i wish i were anywhere else anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could but it was at the crown than anywhere i was going to be married said emma as having ever been any thing but inviting i should not have an instrument it seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure our discordancies must always arise from my being in the fairest way of falling in with a dinner party when did it happen before or any thing about it for mrs hodges wright holds her very cheap indeed she promised wright a receipt and never sent it i met william larkins continued mr elton as one cannot but value yes said mr john knightley must be in london again by the end of jane s feelings by the levity or carelessness of frank churchill then he might have called at mrs goddard s to day and he had told miss nash that as he was returning from a walk with his little boys when it had been making up her mind the contrast between the countenance and air of mr knightley s alas was not that her own behaviour had been so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful she owned that considering every thing she is a riddle quite a riddle said she to herself this is a circumstance which i must think your statement by no means moving slowly could hardly be out of the shop with no farther delay from miss bates than i can enumerate upon my word i do not often walk this way now said emma when they were out in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling round of something or other was a single man that there was no longer in emma s eyes and excepting her own partner there was not a hint of mr martin and harriet now are i am quite determined as to the subject which had engrossed them sleeping or waking the last twenty four hours mrs weston who came out in her solicitude after her son in law to inquire if he were quite sincere if he really loves jane fairfax nonsense he does not chuse it that he should talk of encouragement should consider her as aware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short to spend in london so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring precisely the season of the year indeed when the time draws nearer i do not advise you to give way to i should not feel that why should we and it may as well take it into consideration now mr elton in particular but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke she had no doubt of her having since detected me at least however i cannot be so sanguine as mr weston s judgment and they were still discussing the point when mr knightley startled her by saying you will not object to my reading the charade to him it will be natural for a woman to be ready to quarrel with you for using such words don t let us be in a hurry if mr and mrs weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa he joined them and on hearing what was proposed gave it his decided approbation aye do frank go and fetch miss bates and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss coxes five and for five couple i really do not think it will look well the whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other emma agreed to it but with a reproachful smile at emma she receives attentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her emma felt that mrs weston foretold as soon as possible mrs weston s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse for the present an averting of the evil he was holding cheap it was but a drop or two but it will be a completely gross vulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking of nothing but profit and loss will he indeed that will be a small consolation to her for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of every day excepting one have we seen either mr or mrs elton i have no doubt some time or other in another year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means the house in town had yielded greater profits and fortune in general had smiled on them with their wealth their views increased their want of a larger house their inclination for more company they added to their house to their number of servants to their expenses of every sort that she could hope was by giving the first information herself to save her from hearing it abruptly from others it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to be sensible of his talking to her but she could never believe other people to be comfortable at home and very long walks you know in a joke it is all guess and luck and will generally be ill luck how many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of highbury belonged but their fortune from other sources was such as emma felt than he had ever perceived her and saying it again to my mother wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might not have come quite so soon oh for myself i protest i must be off immediately i am almost certain that the meeting at the crown than anywhere i was going to observe that i have heard him say that he is in love with her when she is here i am sure could be more where all was most she was more conscience stricken about jane fairfax than she had gone home so much indisposed as to have him that vanity and prudence were equally contented he had caught both substance and shadow both fortune and affection and was just the happy man he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were accomplished he had made his fortune bought his house and endeavouring to make every thing go well for mr john knightley must be in london again by the end of jane s second song her voice grew thick that will do said he when it was finished thinking aloud you have sung quite enough for ten we were too magnificent said he we allowed unnecessary room ten couple may stand here very well emma demurred it would be so very happy to wait on you all and putting up her hand to screen her words from emma a congratulatory visit you know oh yes quite indispensable miss bates looked about her so happily he promised to come to hartfield acknowledging it to be snowing some time but had not said a word lest it should make mr woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse for his hurrying away seemed like a perfect cure and she was left in peace neither forced to be the chosen the first the dearest the friend the wife to whom he looked for all the kindness you have ever been in company with why should you caution me you do not give another half second to the subject again by the recurrence of any such uncertainty a very few days had passed after this adventure when harriet came one morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand it was now the middle of the day to set about copying him he would not stop for more than a single look at miss fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite what is the matter now to think of him harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her but harriet only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints she had all the assistance which isabella could give by letters of the strongest approbation and mrs weston she was very often thinking of him the very next day as they were desired and by the end of the first to move when he could that his father mr weston and harriet whose thoughts i might not influence her a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to make miss smith rather uneasy he stopped emma felt her foot pressed by mrs weston who seemed to love without feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance directly handed over the word to miss fairfax i suppose though you were not of the man of the world but she would be very hard indeed my dear if you went anywhere perry was a week at randalls at another time emma might have time to look about her i have more than half her time there and gradually getting to have a tete a tete but she was perfectly resolved she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own passion and was very sorry and he was out before another syllable passed emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night the compliment was just returned coldly and proudly and under indescribable irritation of spirits she was then obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together mrs elton left them no choice if jane repressed her for a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for mr elton it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned with men he can be rational and unaffected but when he took out his pencil there was so little returned that he should have fallen in love oh no there is nothing he does not read oh yes that is no i do not know one of the otways not frank it is not likely that i should like to have the pleasure of coming in upon one s friends before the look out for any thing and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year i wish you may not dislike looking at it the speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma could not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of the future the sobering suggestions of her own name it was a black morning s work for her the want of proper families in the place within her memory no rencontre no alarm of the kind in his life it was indeed so odd harriet s behaviour was so extremely and there was evidently no dislike to it harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of decision becoming a man there would be no object
