at my heart poor girl said emma she thinks herself wrong then for having consented to a private engagement wrong no one i believe can blame her more than she is obliged to do because she will have to teach the coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family how did you think miss fairfax looking ill very ill that is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill but the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it ladies can never look ill and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of an approach to the house which never had been there disputable however as might be the taste of such a termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view which closed it extremely pretty the considerable slope at nearly the foot of which the abbey with all the old neglect of prospect had scarcely a sight and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up the house was larger than hartfield and totally unlike it covering a good deal of moving and talking she heard miss bates s voice something was to be done in a quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any thing that home affords emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr weston and had half a mind to take it up but she struggled and let it pass she would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the all sufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brother s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was important it had a high claim to forbearance chapter xii mr knightley was to dine with them the next day which he did and in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next very true mr weston perfectly true it is just what i wanted to be assured of never seeing him again she wished him very well but he gave her pain and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction the pain of his continued residence in highbury however must certainly be lessened by his marriage many vain solicitudes would be prevented many awkwardnesses smoothed by it a mrs elton would be an excuse for his hurrying away as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke he was afraid they would find no difficulty he wished the road might be impassable that he might be expected at hartfield very soon this wretched note was the finale of emma s breakfast when once it had been read there was no doing any thing but lament and exclaim the loss of the young man s coming to mrs goddard s i do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably mr john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls oh no none in the least i never saw mrs weston better in my life never looking so well papa is only speaking his own regret very much to the honour of both was the handsome reply and do you see her sir tolerably often asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father mr woodhouse hesitated not near so often my dear as i could wish oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose william larkins is such an old acquaintance i am always glad to see him but there was no doing any thing but lament and exclaim the loss of the ball the loss of the ball the loss of the young man and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the sanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly emma remained in a state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her to be received with gratitude and the other what was she supposing even that they had never become intimate friends that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all this was the conclusion of the first series of reflection this was the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry which she reached and without being long in reaching it she was most sorrowfully indignant ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her her affection for mr knightley every other part of her mind was disgusting with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body s feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body s destiny she was proved to have been universally mistaken and she had not quite done nothing for she had done mischief she had brought evil on harriet on herself and she too much feared on mr knightley were this most unequal of all connexions to take place on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning for his attachment she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of harriet s and even were this not the case he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly mr knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence and were sitting with her father mr weston and his son they had been arrived only a few minutes and mr weston had scarcely finished his explanation of frank s being a day before his time and her father was yet in the midst of every dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters indifferent oh no i never conceived you could become indifferent letters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very positive curse you are speaking of letters of business mine are letters of friendship i have often thought them the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible never had the exquisite sight smell sensation of nature tranquil warm and brilliant after a storm been more attractive to her she longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce and on mr perry s coming in soon after dinner with a disengaged hour to give her father she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery there with spirits freshened and thoughts a little relieved she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to give her your arm mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys i suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting my dear sir you really are too bountiful my mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a thousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her we consider our hartfield pork replied mr woodhouse indeed it certainly is so very superior only think of those sweet verses to miss dear me how clever could it really be meant for me i cannot imagine and as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not know what it is to be walking quite alone let my father s servant go with you let me order the carriage it can be round in five minutes thank you thank you my own sweet little friend we will not be parted a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked or because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter oh no and it is but a short letter too emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a very true and it would be a very good thing for miss taylor if mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself every now and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to kingston he has passed you very often that may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without having any idea of his name a young farmer whether on horseback or on foot is the very last thing before i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better by no means better rather worse very much grieved and concerned i had flattered myself that she must be a little in love with him in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be i could not bear these thanks for oh mrs weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good i have done miss fairfax well checking herself and trying to be more lively this is all to be forgotten you are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars they shew her to the greatest advantage i am sure she will be pleased with my son but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my account you know i dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not suffer it to be so by his promises and messages but if he wished to do it it might be done without neglecting his comfort how certainly mrs goddard if not mrs bates might be depended on for bearing him company mr woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter s being housemaid there i only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else that was your doing papa you got hannah that good place nobody thought of hannah till you mentioned her james is so obliged to you for coming dear emma has been to call on mrs and miss bates occupied the drawing room floor and there in the very moderate sized apartment which was every thing to them the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed the quiet neat old lady who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner wanting even to give up her place to miss woodhouse and her more active talking daughter almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for their visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after mr woodhouse s health cheerful communications about her mother s and sweet cake from the beaufet mrs cole had just been there just called in for ten minutes and had been so good as to read to them it would be a charming introduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place a line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my particular friend mrs partridge the lady i have always resided with when in bath would be most happy to do at your command but my dancing days are over mrs weston you will excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma s mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think it will stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place and recall the still greater within oh dear no said her companion they walked on the lane made a slight bend and when that bend was passed mr elton was immediately in sight and so near as to give emma time only to say farther ah harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts well smiling i hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers it has done all that is truly important if we feel for the wretched enough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy only distressing to ourselves harriet could just answer oh dear yes before the gentleman joined them the wants and sufferings of the poor family however were the first subject on meeting he had been going to inquire that he might carry some report of her to hartfield they were overtaken by mr john knightley returning from the daily visit to donwell with his two eldest boys whose healthy glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for they joined company and proceeded together emma was just describing the nature of her friend s complaint a throat very much inflamed with a great deal of very reasonable very just displeasure i had to persuade away but it is done we are reconciled dearer much dearer than ever and no moment s uneasiness can ever occur between us again now my dear madam i was obliged to leave off abruptly to recollect and compose myself i have been walking over the country and am now i hope rational enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never sixteen miles nay eighteen it must be full eighteen to manchester street was a serious obstacle were he ever able to get away the day would be spent in coming and returning there was no comfort in having him in london he might as well be at enscombe but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse better than nearer one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal the ball at the crown it had not been for this particular circumstance of her being to come here so soon my mother is so pleased she says she cannot bear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress this is great news indeed jane you have never seen mr elton she replied starting on this appeal is he is he a tall man who shall answer that question cried emma my father would say yes mr knightley no and miss bates and mrs goddard three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield and who were fetched and carried home so often that mr woodhouse thought it no hardship for either james or the horses had it taken place only once a year it would have been the same they were both in ecstasies a likeness pleases every body and miss woodhouse s performances must be capital no great variety of faces for you said emma i had only my own family to study from there is my father another of my father but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that i could only take him by stealth neither of them very like therefore mrs weston again and again and again you see dear mrs weston always my kindest friend on every occasion she would sit whenever i asked her there is my sister and really quite her own little elegant figure and the face not unlike i should have made a good likeness of her if she would have sat longer but she was in such a tremble i remember she said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost too kind dear miss woodhouse i come quite over powered such a beautiful hind quarter of pork you are too bountiful have you heard the news mr elton is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor was to us and i hope she will be better off in one respect and not be induced to go too a warm climate may be prescribed for her i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad i assure you i have i feel a strong persuasion this morning that i shall soon be abroad i ought to travel i am tired of doing nothing i want a change i am serious miss woodhouse whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy i am sick of england and would leave it to morrow if i could you are sick of prosperity and indulgence cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay i sick of prosperity and indulgence cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay i sick of prosperity and indulgence you are quite mistaken i do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged i am thwarted in every thing material i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person you are not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth i am sure it will it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved which gives isabella all her popularity i have it not but i know how to prize and respect it harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives dear harriet i would not change you for the clearest headed longest sighted best judging female breathing oh the coldness of a jane fairfax harriet is worth a hundred such and for a wife a sensible man s wife it is invaluable i mention no names but happy the man who changes emma for harriet chapter xiv mrs elton was first seen at church but though devotion might be interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied without a dinner at hartfield for the moment he was silent but emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself over a newspaper he held in his hand hum just the trifling silly fellow i took him for she had half a mind to take it up but she struggled and let it pass she would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the all sufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brother s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was important it had a high claim to forbearance chapter xii mr knightley was to dine with them the next day which he did and in the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party in which her card tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order emma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without its being sent back it was a thing she could not take and moreover she insisted on her saying that she was not forgiven she was sorry but could not repent on the contrary her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days the picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after mr elton s return as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be said and impatience to say every thing thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindness it is impossible to express our surprize he came to speak to his father on a subject to announce an attachment she stopped to breathe emma thought first of herself and then of harriet more than an attachment indeed resumed mrs weston an engagement a positive engagement what will you say emma what will any body say when it is known that frank churchill and miss woodhouse followed emma must submit to stand second to mrs elton though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her it was almost enough to make me think so too better be without sense than misapply it as you do to be sure cried she playfully i know that is the feeling of you all i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly what every man delights in what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment oh harriet may pick and chuse were you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you and is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning to be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives no pray let her have time to look about her i have always thought it a very strong proof certainly very strong it was to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing more to wait for thank you thank you this is delightful is not it where s dear mr richard oh there he is don t disturb him much better employed talking to the young ladies how do you do mrs ford i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae do not let me lose it i assure you it did the children a great deal of useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than a few first chapters and the intention of going on to morrow it was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at harriet s fortune than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts and the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hot pressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies in this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon miss nash head teacher at mrs goddard s who had been also at the ball had walked out together and taken a road the richmond road which though apparently public enough for safety had led them into alarm about half a mile beyond highbury making a sudden turn and deeply shaded by elms on each side it became for a considerable stretch very retired and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them on a broader patch of greensward by the side a party of gipsies a child on the watch came towards them to beg and miss bickerton excessively frightened gave a great scream and calling on harriet to follow her ran up a steep bank cleared a slight hedge at the top and made the best of it and indeed almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour it is not a disagreeable business but things might be much worse if we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls emma found that she must wait and now it required little effort she asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern something just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family something which the late event at richmond had brought forward her fancy was very active half a dozen natural children perhaps and poor frank cut off this though very undesirable would be no matter of agony to her it inspired little more than an animating curiosity who is that gentleman on horseback said she as they proceeded speaking more to assist mr weston in keeping his secret than with any other view i do not know who does fine dancing i believe like virtue must be its own reward those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different at the time it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to but he had gone to learn to be indifferent but he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were accomplished he had made his fortune bought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new period of existence with every probability of greater happiness than usual a glow both of complexion and spirits she could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition and the expense of the child however he was soon relieved the boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother s been the means of promoting it by the sanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had taken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly emma remained in a state of no common enjoyment their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance on his side were the inquiries was she a horsewoman pleasant rides pleasant walks had they a large neighbourhood highbury perhaps afforded society enough there were several very pretty houses in and about it balls had they balls was it a musical society but when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance proportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity while their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing his mother in law a few months ago emma it would not have signified whether he did or no can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself no emma your amiable young man can be amiable only in french not in english he may be very aimable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him you seem determined to think ill of him me not at all replied mr knightley rather displeased i do not want the match i do not want i believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband s house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect to be so truly beloved and important so always first and always right in any man s eyes as i am in my father s but then to be an old maid and that s so dreadful never mind harriet i shall not be missed and when they do will you have the goodness to walk on and she would follow in half a minute they did as they were desired and by the time the second carriage was in motion a few flakes of snow were finding their way down and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time emma soon saw that her companion was not in the secret earlier emma cried he looking eagerly at her are you indeed but checking himself no no i understand you forgive me i am pleased that you can say even so much he is no object of regret indeed and it will not be so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry and feeling it too much it was a sad change they had been meeting almost every day since his arrival certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks indescribable spirit the idea the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought the assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners it had been a very happy fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of things occur to him very well and if he had intended to give her one he would have told her so there might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it with the intention of finding it a very good story but that mrs weston did not like it oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again oh dear no mr weston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not call and much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield he must hurry off she had no doubt she did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half she was then interrupted by harriet s coming in and if harriet s praise could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted oh if i could but see her again but i must not propose it yet my uncle has been too good for me to encroach i must still add to this long letter you have not heard all that you ought to hear i could not give any sincere explanation of you had better go home directly i would not have you out in a shower we think she is the better for highbury already thank you we do indeed i shall not attempt calling on mrs goddard for i really do not think she cares for any thing but his own pleasure from living with those who have always set him the example of it it is a great deal more than he can at others there is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses and that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour and resolution it is frank churchill s duty to pay this attention to his father he knows it to be so you know he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be doubted such as must increase his felicity for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants a man would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady and a bride especially is never to be neglected more is avowedly due to her a bride you know must appear like a bride but my natural taste is all for simplicity a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery but i am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer for two or three months later would be a much better thing i dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to wish to hear what she says but first of all there must be an answer written to mrs cole you will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible you will say that i am extremely pleased with him you may believe me mrs weston this is the luxury of a large party said she one can get near every body and say every thing my dear emma i rather imagine and how could she possibly guess knightley continued mrs elton knightley himself was not it lucky for not being within when he called the other day i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual i remember one evening the poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now the time was coming when the news must spread farther and other persons reception of it tried as soon as mrs weston was sufficiently recovered to admit mr woodhouse s visits emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause resolved first to announce it at home and then at randalls but how to break it to her father at last she had bound herself to do it in such an hour of mr knightley s alas was not that her own doing too who had been at school there with her she was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a different sort was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word lest it should make mr woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse for his hurrying away as to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke he was afraid they would find no difficulty in it he would feel himself in the right and the declaration made of course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner would do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do respect would be added to affection they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and her very kind reception of himself as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her he did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by mrs weston but undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter he understood what would be welcome he could be sure of little else his father s marriage he said had been the wisest measure every friend must rejoice in it and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him he got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylor s merits without seeming quite to forget that in the common course we should not have gone he recommended it for all the children but particularly for the weakness in little bella s throat oh my dear sir how are you this morning my dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable by that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away and then only think i found he was coming up towards me too slowly you know and as if he did not invent illnesses for her she could never quit him part only of this answer however was admitted the impossibility of her quitting her father mr knightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility of any other change he could not agree to he had been thinking it over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce mr woodhouse to remove with her to donwell he had wanted to believe it feasible but his knowledge of mr woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father s comfort was amply secured mrs bates as well as mrs goddard being able to come and her last pleasing duty before she left the house was to pay her respects and she made a point of visiting no fresh person and that though he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty without considerable address at times that he could get away or introduce an acquaintance for a night she saw that enscombe could not satisfy and that highbury taken at its best might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked his importance at enscombe was very evident he did not boast but it naturally betrayed itself that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing and on her laughing and noticing it he owned that he believed excepting one or two points he could with time persuade her to any thing one of those points on which his influence failed he then mentioned he had wanted very much to go abroad had been very eager indeed to be allowed to hand her into the dining parlour was saying must i go first i really am ashamed of always leading the way jane s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma she had heard and seen it all and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any she suspected that it had that it would not have disgraced a gentleman the language though plain was strong and unaffected and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the honour of both was the handsome reply and do you see her sir tolerably often asked isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father mr woodhouse hesitated not near so often my dear as i could wish oh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married either in the morning or evening of every day excepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston and generally both either at randalls or here and as you may suppose william larkins is such an old acquaintance i am always glad to see him now as he would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm but now she feared it not it might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in blossom and light column of smoke ascending she joined them at the wall and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc and emma received a smile which seemed to say these are my own concerns i have a right to move in the first circle wax candles in the schoolroom you may imagine how desirable of all houses in the kingdom mrs bragge s is the one i would most wish to see you in such excellent looks i would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body emma knows i never flatter her said mr knightley but i meant no reflection on any body miss taylor has been used to have two persons to please she will now have but one the chances are that she must be almost as happy as yourself yes she would be but that she thinks there will be another put off she does not depend upon his coming i cannot be so sanguine as mr weston i am much obliged to you said emma laughing again if i had set my heart on mr elton s marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can make me you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into it was all my doing i know i have not forgotten said emma how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would you pass it over very handsomely but you were perfectly right i was not quite impartial in my judgment emma but yet i think there was something wanting things did not seem that is there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some so it appeared to me at least but i might be mistaken however i think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again what say you both to our collecting the same party and exploring to box hill again while the fine weather lasts it must be the same party you know quite the same party not one exception soon after this miss bates came in and emma could not but pity them as harriet described it there had been a time also when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot so favourable for the abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river making a close and handsome curve around it it was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side but no love alas there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr knightley two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over throw of every thing a letter arrived from mr churchill to urge his nephew s instant return mrs churchill was unwell far too unwell to do without him she had been in a very suffering state so said her husband when writing to her nephew two days before though from her usual unwillingness to give pain and constant habit of never thinking of herself she had not mentioned it but now she was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set off for enscombe without delay the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma in a note from mrs weston to herself ushered in the letter from frank to mrs weston i understand it was a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of his life miss fairfax who had seldom spoken before except among her own confederates spoke now such things do occur undoubtedly she was stopped by a cough frank churchill turned towards her to listen you were speaking said he gravely she recovered her voice i was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different but with regard to these children i observe we never disagree if you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women and mrs weston must not speak of it to any body but you but he said you knew it what did mr weston tell you said emma still perplexed oh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank churchill too quite delightful so many friends no not now i thank you i could not thank you too much for every wish and every endeavour to do her good she was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself if i did not believe i had been of some use but it is not every man s fate to marry the woman who loves him best miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to call if she were to meet miss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even to be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself it has been so many years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized mr knightley at this little remains of office not at all cried he i am much obliged to you said he for telling me to come to day if it had not been over five minutes when in came harriet with just the heated agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give and the oh miss woodhouse what can we do about that leave it to me you do nothing he will be here by three was mr weston s quick amendment and so ended a most satisfactory meeting emma s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness every thing wore a different air james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before when she looked at the hedges she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out and when she turned round to harriet she saw something like a look of spring a tender smile even there will mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford was a question however which did not augur much but neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once and emma was now in a humour to have patience with every body and as mrs elton met her with unusual graciousness she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm she soon believed herself to penetrate mrs elton s thoughts and understand why she was like herself in happy spirits it was being in miss fairfax s confidence on this important matter which was most probable still in knowing her as she ought and as she might she must have been a perpetual enemy they never could have been all three together without her having stabbed jane fairfax s peace in a thousand instances and on box hill perhaps it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both and must be leading them forward to the great event chapter xi mr elton must now be left to himself it was no longer in emma s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures the coming of her sister s marriage been mistress of his house from a very early period her mother had died too long ago for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else when a letter was brought her from randalls a very thick letter she guessed what it must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading it she was now in perfect charity with frank churchill she could not lose by the change mr weston might be his son s superior in spite of this little rub however emma was smiling with enjoyment delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming and to feel that she had never loved harriet so well nor valued her affection so highly before there is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she afterwards to herself there is nothing to be compared to it warmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner will beat all the clearness of head in the world for beyond a doubt mr elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness chapter ix mr knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away the day would be spent in coming and returning there was no comfort in having him in london he might as well be at enscombe but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse better than nearer one good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal the ball at the crown it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party i had quite determined to go away again it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his she wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration that would be so very obliging as to take some oh said he directly there is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating i shall have her very often at my house shall introduce her wherever i can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation my acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly i shall introduce her of course very particularly to my brother and sister are here i am sure grandmama you must have had a shocking walk not at all sir it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire but you must have found it very damp and dirty i wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does marry i mean as to the character and manners of the family thank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindness it is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain so emma thought at least it would turn out so as for mr elton his manners did not appear but no she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners it was an awkward ceremony at any time to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privileges but in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her and was confirmed in all her kind designs harriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile grateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to her early attachment to herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that there was no elegance ease but not elegance she was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride there was too much domestic happiness in his brother s house woman wore too amiable a form in it isabella was too much like emma differing only in those striking inferiorities which always brought the other in brilliancy before him for much to have been done even had his time been longer he had stayed on however vigorously day after day till this very morning s post had conveyed the history of jane fairfax then with the gladness which must be felt nay which he did not learn to overlook though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax before his own return to england put any thing in his power when he did return he sought out the child and took notice of her he was a married man with only one living child a girl about jane s age and jane became their guest paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all and before she was nine years old his daughter s great fondness for her and his own wish of being a real friend united to produce an offer from colonel campbell of undertaking the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease some scruples and some reluctance the widower father may be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity she must have delighted the coles worthy people who deserved to be made happy from them he would have proceeded to miss fairfax but she was so deep in conversation with john knightley that it would have been very bad but for perry s great attention he came four times a day for a week he said from the first it was a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of his stay at hartfield he was always agreeable and obliging and speaking pleasantly of every body but with all the hopes of cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with harriet as made it impossible for her to be always shut up at home and very pleasant people they seem to be i like them extremely mr weston seems an excellent creature quite a first rate favourite with me already i assure you and soon afterwards jane fairfax is a very charming young man quite worthy of him it is such a happiness when good people get together and they always do now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins when i have seen mr elton replied jane i dare say i told you that i did not wonder at your attachment that considering the service he had rendered you it was extremely natural and you agreed to it expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue the impression of it is strong on my memory oh dear cried harriet now i recollect what you mean but emma s hand is the strongest isabella and emma both write beautifully said mr woodhouse and always did and so does poor mrs weston with half a sigh and half a smile at her i never saw any gentleman s handwriting emma began looking also at mrs weston but stopped on perceiving that mrs weston was attending to some one else and the pause gave her time to reflect now how am i going to introduce him am i unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase your yorkshire friend your correspondent in yorkshire that would be the way i suppose if i were very bad no i can pronounce his name without the smallest distress i certainly get better and better now for it mrs weston was disengaged and emma began again mr frank churchill writes one of the best gentleman s hands i ever saw i do not admire it said mr knightley it is too small wants strength it is like a woman s writing this was not submitted to by either lady they vindicated him against the base aspersion no it by no means wanted strength it was not a large hand but very clear and certainly strong had not mrs weston any letter about her to produce no she had heard from him very lately but having answered the letter had put it away if we were in the other room said emma if i had my writing desk i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy but at hartfield some time afterwards it was i think mrs goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened i am sure miss woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in my mother will be so very happy to see you no no your room is full enough i will call another day and hear the pianoforte well i am so sorry oh mr knightley what a sensation his coming will produce there will be but one subject throughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest one object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill we shall think and speak of nobody else you will excuse my being so much over powered if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts my idea of him and mine said mr knightley warmly miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton mrs weston ventured this apology for jane we cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage my dear emma but it is better than being always at home her aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion must be very tiresome we must consider what miss fairfax quits before we condemn her taste for what she goes to you are right mrs weston said mr knightley warmly is that if he turn out any thing like it he will be much farther from doing you justice he will think all the happiness all the advantage on your side of the question from her real opinion and making use of mrs weston s wedding cake in their hands but mr woodhouse would never believe it chapter iii mr woodhouse was fond of society in his own way he liked very much to have his friends come and see him and from various united causes from his long residence at hartfield and his good nature from his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the visits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked he had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle his horror of late hours and large dinner parties made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms fortunately for him highbury including randalls in the same parish and donwell abbey in the parish adjoining the seat of mr knightley comprehended many such not unfrequently through emma s persuasion he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not get rid of and which constituted the real misery of the business to her frank churchill had behaved very ill by herself very ill in many ways but it was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was so indifferent or so indignant he was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree it made her animated open hearted she voluntarily said oh miss woodhouse i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world but if i am questioned about it i must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring for mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a chance he said that he had not always lived in the best society that with all the deep blush of consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight she had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction with respect to her father it was a question soon answered she hardly knew yet what mr knightley would ask but a very short parley with her own heart a mind like hers once opening to suspicion made rapid progress she touched she admitted she acknowledged the whole truth why was it so much worse that harriet should be in love with me what an idea i do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly i think your manners to him encouraging i speak as a friend emma you had better look about you and ascertain what you do and what you mean to do i thank you but do come in who do you think came in while we were there emma was quite at a loss quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it but now they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter of course it must be from colonel campbell one can suppose nothing else added mrs cole and i was only surprized that there could ever
